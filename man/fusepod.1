.SH NAME
fusepod \- iPod virtual filesystem
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fusepod [ options ] mountpoint
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B FUSEPod
is a userspace virtual filesystem which mounts your iPod into a directory for
easy browsing of your songs on your iPod.
.SH USAGE

To mount your ipod type at the console:
.RS
.br        
.BI "fusepod" " mount_to"
.RE
        
If
.B FUSEPod
fails to find your iPod you can specify the iPod's mountpoint
through the environment variable
.B IPOD_DIR.
Note that the iPod must already be mounted so that you can read it.

For example, say my iPod is mounted at
.I /media/IPOD
and I want to mount the
.B FUSEPod
layer at
.I /home/keegan/ipod

You would enter at the console:
.RS
.br
.B IPOD_DIR="/media/IPOD" fusepod /home/keegan/ipod
.RE

You can also create the necessary files and directories for your iPod to
work.
.B FUSEPod
will prompt you if you specify
.B IPOD_DIR
which does not have the necessary structure.

To unmount FUSEPod type at the console:
.RS
.br
.BI "fusermount -u" " mounted_to"
.RE

To add songs copy them too
.RS
.br
.B [mounted_to]/Transfer
.RE

Or add the absolute path of the song to the file
.RS
.br
.B [mounted_to]/add_songs
.RE

You can also add files and recusrively add directories through
.RS
.br
.B [mounted_to]/add_files.sh [ files/directories ] ...
.RE

And then to sync the database and copy the files run
.RS
.br
.B [mounted_to]/sync_ipod.sh [ -watch ]
.RE

You can the view all the songs that will be added to the iPod by
viewing the files in the Transfer directory and the songs in the file
.B add_songs.

If you are happy with the contents of add_songs and the Transfer
directory you can run the command:
.RS
.br
.B ./sync_ipod.sh
.RE
